  Hello world, I have never really coded before, therefore I don't really know what I'm doing. my class is supposed to help me learn coding, however school is evil and shall destroy the world...


  Week 2: I learned some stuff, like how binary kinda works... it still confuses me, please send help.
  

  week 3: I was sick basically all week, so I just stayed home and read.

  Week ???(7): its been a while since I have written here, so I forgot which week this is.... it has been ok so far, but it is still school so it sucks.(it is week 7)

  Week ??? > 7: it has been some time, I think, school still sucks but instead of a bus I go to and from school in a nearly white van.
